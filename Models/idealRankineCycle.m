function [ x2,eff,Wt,Wp,Qin ] = idealRankineCycle(P1,P2,T1)
% ideal rankine cycle analysis

% subscripts and associated states
% 1 - turbine inlet
% 2 - turbine outlet
% 3 - condensor outlet
% 4 - boiler inlet

% P1 - condenser pressure [
% P2 - boiler pressure

% Assumptions
    % Pump and turbine are adiabatic and reversible (sentropic) compression
    % and expansion, respectively

% turbine inlet
h1 = XSteam('h_pT',P2,T1);
s1 = XSteam('s_ph',P2,h1);

% entropy remains the same through turbine ( ideal )
s2=s1;
h2 = XSteam('h_ps',P1,s2);
x2 = XSteam('x_ps',P1,s2);

if (x2 < 0.88 )
    disp('Steam quality less than 88%.');
    fprintf('\n\n\n');
end

% condenser outlet
T3 = XSteam('Tsat_P',P1);
h3 = XSteam('hL_P',P1);
v3 = XSteam('vL_p',P1);

% calculating h4 from pump work
h4 = h3 + v3*(P2-P1)*1e2;

% calculating pump work, turbine work and heat input
Wt = h1 - h2
Wp = h4 - h3
Wnet = Wt + Wp % Cycle net specific work
Qin = h1 - h4

% calculating efficiency
eff = (Wt - Wp)/Qin
